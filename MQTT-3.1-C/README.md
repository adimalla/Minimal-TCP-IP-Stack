## Description
The Goal of the project is to create an MQTT client API, portable in both POSIX and non POSIX embedded system enviornments. The APIs are minimal, easy to understand and independent of posix sockets and other socket based or networking APIs and are implemented in C for ease of portablity in resource constrained embedded devices.

## Features
Currently the APIs are tesed with C console applications under Linux enviornment using socket API and comes with publisher state machine example code that supports quality of service upto level 2 and message retention at MQTT broker.
The API only supports publisher control packet methods with qos level 2 and subscriber with qos level 0.

You can test the publisher client from the Examples Directory, execution flags are similar to natve mosquitto_pub client script. Supported flags are mentenioned in the help message generated by the app.


## Porting and Instalation

### Linux
Currently there are no instalation scripts, however, in development code is available in API directory.
